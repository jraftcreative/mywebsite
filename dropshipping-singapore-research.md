## 2. Shipping Times to Singapore from Various Suppliers

| Supplier / Route | Standard Shipping | Express Shipping | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| CJ Dropshipping (China) | 7-17 days total | 3-7 days (warehouse stock) | CJPacket JL Express recommended |
| AliExpress (China) | 6-10 days | 3-7 days (AliExpress Standard) | Varies widely by seller |
| Spocket (US/EU) | 7-15 days | 5-10 days | Higher shipping costs |
| Printify/Printful (varies) | 10-20 days | 7-14 days | Includes production time |
| Bangreat (China) | ~7 days | 3-5 days (to Korea/Japan) | SEA-optimized logistics |

## 3. Local/Regional Suppliers in Southeast Asia

### The Reality
Singapore does not have many (if any) dedicated dropshipping suppliers based locally. The most practical approaches for faster regional shipping include:

### Regional Strategies

**CJ Dropshipping Singapore Warehouse**
- Products pre-stocked in Singapore warehouse can ship in 1-3 days domestically
- Limited product selection compared to China warehouse
- Must request products to be stocked

**Shopee/Lazada Wholesale Sellers**
- Some sellers on Shopee and Lazada offer wholesale pricing
- Can act as informal dropshipping suppliers
- Shipping within Singapore takes 1-3 days
- Not traditional dropshipping setup; requires manual order fulfillment

**China-Based Suppliers with SEA Warehouses**
- CJ Dropshipping, EPROLO, and HyperSKU maintain regional warehouses
- Products shipped from SEA hubs (Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam) reach Singapore in 2-5 days
- Requires selecting products already stocked in regional warehouses

**Key Manufacturing Regions Supplying Singapore**
- Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian (China) -- electronics, textiles, consumer goods
- Shenzhen -- tech accessories, gadgets
- Yiwu -- general merchandise, small commodities

### Hybrid Model (Recommended for Serious Sellers)
The emerging 2025 trend in SEA is a hybrid approach:
- Hold limited stock of fast-moving items locally (in Singapore or a 3PL warehouse)
- Dropship slower-moving or test products from China
- Shopee and Lazada algorithms actively prioritize sellers offering faster shipping in their rankings and promotions
